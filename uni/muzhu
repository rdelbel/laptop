normally feature screening. lots of 2 sample t tests. (mean difference). LInear kernel does least amount of extra things. If that somehow increases power then we have a story to tell. 

Start with the linear.

Screen out noise observations. Dont want to throw away to many.
Remove 1%, 5%, 10% 

a few 'classical cases' to show. 
Simulation from 2 gaussian (relatively high dimensional, only signal in a few directions). 
1) Simulation 5 variables (all gaussian), group 1 y=f() group 2 y=g(). 
Then generate 200 random guys for the 2 groups. Can control difficulty of the problem 


First thing to do.

2 dimensional gaussian. can control difficulty by seperating the 2 gaussians. At least two paramaters. difference of the 2 means, and the number of noise dimensions. Simulation from spherical gaussian or use correlation.

If the 2 gaussian covariance are th esame then know the optimal decision is a straight line. can simulate to have different covariace matrix. In this case lienar is bad and gaussian could do better.

Applied contribution. Will this be attractive who constantly screen with features. 

Do some genetic. SVM is best when its applied to homogenous data

Since this is preprossing step. 
IF we know the answer then we can have the ranking. 
Focus on identifying factors for higher power.
One thing we shoudl look at is p-value.
See if 

Can compute ROC based under the ranked list and identifier of if they are true or not.

First do linear support vector machine. DO the whole thing just for linear. 

Simulation
Diagonal, autogressive, equivariant.
