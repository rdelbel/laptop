select * from EMPLOYEE where EMPLOYEE_ID INTERSECT select * from EMPLOYEE where EMPLOYEE_ID < 4

Explanation : Here INTERSECT command is used to fetch data that are common in 2 queries. In this example, we had taken EMPLOYEE table in both the queries.We can apply INTERSECT command on different tables. The result of the above query will return employee details of "ROY" because, employee id of ROY is 3, and both query results have the information about ROY.

select EMPLOYEE_ID from EMPLOYEE

MINUS

select EMPLOYEE_REF_ID from INCENTIVES
