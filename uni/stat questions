GLM
LR test statistic is called the deviance (D)
D=2*(l(unconstrained)-l(constrained) ~ chisq_(q-p)
saturated mle for binary is pi_i=y_i/m_i
Regression models impose constrains on the estimate of pi_i through x_i^tbeta
D~chisq_(n-p) is residual deviance 
DeltaDeviance test


Use learning curves to see if we are overfitting or underfitting
Look at misclassified guys see if I can use any human knowledge to get some inspiration 
maybe cluster them
